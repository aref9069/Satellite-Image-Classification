# Satellite-Image-Classification
Satellite-Image-Classification is a machine learning project focused on classifying satellite imagery into agricultural and non-agricultural land categories. The project demonstrates the complete workflow from dataset acquisition and preprocessing to image loading, transformation, and preparation for model training.
Using NumPy and Matplotlib for image processing, this repository builds a structured data pipeline suitable for computer vision tasks such as land-use classification and remote sensing analysis. The project is designed as a foundational step toward implementing deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for automated satellite image classification.
